# Sustainable Catalyst Research Librarian AI v8.0.0

A site-scoped connected research intelligence platform with Library-native research objects, persistent individual research state, collaborative Research Rooms, descriptive evidence-quality signals, federated global discovery, governed Workspace artifact promotion, and a first-class inspectable research lifecycle. See `docs/V800_UNIFIED_RESEARCH_INTELLIGENCE_LIFECYCLE.md`.

## v8.0.0 highlights

- Unifies the v7.2–v7.7 research capabilities into **Frame → Discover → Evaluate → Organize → Collaborate → Synthesize → Promote → Preserve**.
- Adds durable lifecycle records, transition events, deterministic readiness signals, blockers, next actions, and immutable fingerprinted checkpoints.
- Requires explicit human confirmation for every lifecycle stage transition; no AI or heuristic can silently advance research state.
- Keeps lifecycle/readiness metadata outside evidence, truth judgments, editorial approval, and publication.
- Carries lifecycle events and checkpoints in project backup/export while preserving Library, Research Room, federated-discovery, and Workspace-promotion provenance boundaries.
- Advances ancillary SQLite to schema 18, Connected Research API to 2.0, and public workspace to 3.0 without changing the Neon/Postgres knowledge-index schema.

## Architecture

WordPress remains the canonical publishing, administration, identity, and recovery boundary. FastAPI uses Neon/Postgres for production knowledge generations, source records, retrieval chunks, and pgvector embeddings. SQLite remains the local-development and ancillary governance/workspace/Library-context/research-state/collaboration/promotion/lifecycle store in v8.0.0. Generation is isolated behind `sc-generation-adapter/1.0`; deterministic retrieval and project continuity remain usable when generation is unavailable.

## Runtime

- Python 3.12.12
- FastAPI
- Neon-compatible PostgreSQL with pgvector for the production knowledge index
- SQLite schema 18 for local development and ancillary platform/Library/research-state/collaboration/promotion/lifecycle records
- Knowledge-index schema remains `sc-research-librarian-knowledge-index/13.0`
- WordPress 6.0+
- No Render persistent disk is required for the durable production knowledge index
